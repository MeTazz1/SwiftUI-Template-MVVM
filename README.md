# SwiftUI-Template-MVVM 
> A ready-to-use SwiftUI MVVM template to use when creating a new project, including Core Data and standard App Configuration 


This template is intended to reduce the amount of takes to create and setup a new project with SwiftUI. 

It includes a sample project that contains:
* MVVM Design Architecture (Model - View - ViewModel) with a subfolder for each category,
* CoreData setup,
  * an example Item and its extension for custom methods and computer properties,
* Sample views using Core Data objects as ObservedObject, in a List
  * HomeView
  * DetailsView
* Tests, 

Feel free to clone this template and to reuse it!

XCode, target iOS 13
## Installation



```sh
